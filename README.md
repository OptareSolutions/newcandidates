# Useful info to do the Optare Solutions technical assignment

## Introduction

The assignment is designed to understand how you work and your preferences. Don't feel nervous, there is no a correct answer, the source code may not compile and you can search in Google and Stackoverflow, we also do it!

## What am I going to do?

The idea is quite simple:

1. You will start a videoconference with one of the Optare Solutions software engineers and you will share your screen so the interviewer can help you if you need any assistance.
2. Interviewer will give you access to a private repository where you will find a markdown file explaining the assignment.
3. You will have 30 minutes to work on it, and, ideally, upload the solution to github.

\*\*Make sure you connect to the meeting at the scheduled time! Link should be on the e-mail and a platform like Meets https://meet.google.com or https://zoom.us/ will be used.

Some things you must consider:

- This isn't a exam, we don't expect you finish the assignment so don't feel nervous. Just try to work in the assignement as you usually do in a real life task.
- If you don't know git/github, be carefull, the upload may take longer that expected.
- Use English if possible.
- Java and Groovy are our favourites languages.
- Ask to your interviewer whatever you want, we are with you to help.

## Requirements

You are going to need for the assignment:

- A laptop with internet.
- Firefox or Chrome browser.
- One GitHub account.
- Your favorite tools to develop in Java/Groovy, feel free to use whatever you want.

## Things to check

1. Be sure you can access to the meeting link from your network
2. Check how github and git works, it's always a good moment to learn it.
3. You should know how to create a new project in your favourite IDE. You will need to do it as part of the assignment.
4. Be familiar with Maven or Gradle may help.
5. If you have more than 2 years of experience with Java, you may need a Java Application Server as SpringBoot (tomcat), WebLogic, Jetty, Glassfish or JBoss. Make sure you have one ready (just one, you can choose your favourite) and with the dependencies downloaded in your laptop.
6. You may need to use ssh or scp.
