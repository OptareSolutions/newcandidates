# Useful info to do the NetApps technical assignment

## Introduction

The assignment is designed to understand how you work and what your preferences are. Don't feel nervous, there is no a correct answer, the source code may not compile and you can search in Google and Stackoverflow, we also do it!

## What am I going to do? 

The idea is quite simple:

1. You will start a videoconference with one of the NetApps developers and you will share your screen so the interviewer can help you if you need any assistance. 
2. Interviewer will give you access to a private repository where you will find a markdown file explaining the assignment.
3. You will have 30 minutes to upload the solution to github.

*Make sure you connect to https://appear.in/netapps-interview at the scheduled time!*

Some things you must consider:

- Be careful, if you don't know git/github, the upload may take longer that expected.
- Use English where you can use it.
- Java and Groovy are our favourites languages.
- Ask to your interviewer whatever you want, we are with you to help.

## Requirements

You are going to need for the assignment:

- a Laptop with internet Chrome browser.
- One GITHUB account.
- your favorite tools to develop in JAVA, feel free to use whatever you want.

## Things to check

1. Be sure you can connect and use https://appear.in/netapps-interview in your network.
2. Check how github and git works, it's always a good moment to learn it. 

Some assignments may involved download a lot of dependencies, you will find in this repository a Maven file, so you can execute:

```
mvn clean install embedded-glassfish:run
```

Now open a browser and navigate to the URL http://localhost:8080/, you should find a Hello World! message.

Just a small tip: the assignment may be based in this project structure ;-)
