# Useful info to do the Optare Solutions technical assignment

## Introduction

The assignment is designed to understand how you work and your preferences. Don't feel nervous, there is no a correct answer, the source code may not compile and you can search in Google and Stackoverflow, we also do it!

## What am I going to do? 

The idea is quite simple:

1. You will start a videoconference with one of the Optare Solutions software engineers and you will share your screen so the interviewer can help you if you need any assistance. 
2. Interviewer will give you access to a private repository where you will find a markdown file explaining the assignment.
3. You will have 30 minutes to work on it, and, ideally, upload the solution to github.

**Make sure you connect to https://appear.in/optare-interview at the scheduled time! Other platforms (i.e. Hangouts or Zoom) may be proposed by your interviewer**

Some things you must consider:

- This isn't a exam, we don't expect you finish the assignment so don't feel nervous. Just try to work in the assignement as you usually do in a real life task.
- If you don't know git/github, be carefull, the upload may take longer that expected.
- Use English if possible.
- Java and Groovy are our favourites languages.
- Ask to your interviewer whatever you want, we are with you to help.

## Requirements

You are going to need for the assignment:

- A laptop with internet.
- Firefox or Chrome browser.
- One GitHub account.
- Your favorite tools to develop in Java/Groovy, feel free to use whatever you want.

## Things to check
