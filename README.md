# Useful info to do the NetApps technical assignment

## Introduction

The assignment is designed to understand how you work and your preferences. Don't feel nervous, there is no a correct answer, the source code may not compile and you can search in Google and Stackoverflow, we also do it!

## What am I going to do? 

The idea is quite simple:

1. You will start a videoconference with one of the NetApps developers and you will share your screen so the interviewer can help you if you need any assistance. 
2. Interviewer will give you access to a private repository where you will find a markdown file explaining the assignment.
3. You will have 30 minutes to work on it, and, ideally, upload the solution to github.

Some things you must consider:

- Be careful, if you don't know git/github, the upload may take longer that expected.
- Use English where you can use it.
- Java and Groovy are our favourites languages.
- Ask to your interviewer whatever you want, we are with you to help.
